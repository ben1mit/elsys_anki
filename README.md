This is a repository for collaborating on making Anki-cards for the subjects at Electronic system design at NTNU

IF YOU ARE GOING TO COMMIT ANKI CARDS YOU CREATED, PLEASE TAG THEM AS FOLLOWS:

creator::\<github-user-name>
  
I recommend doing a batch edit of all your cards so that before you commit you search for the cards lacking the tag creator, and add your own username for that.

this line is a test , please ignore it
